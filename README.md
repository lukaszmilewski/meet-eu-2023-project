## General
 “Meet-EU” is an international team-based course organised by five 4EU+ member universities (Heidelberg, Milan, Paris, Prague, Warsaw) as part of the 4EU+ joint educational offer during the academic year 2023/2024. Meet-EU has been designed to promote interdisciplinary training through research and welcomes students from different disciplines, from computer science, physics and mathematics to chemistry, biology and biotechnologies. 

 Students are asked to address and solve a specific research problem under the supervision of tutors at each university. Students organize themselves in small groups of 4-5 students each. Each group works independently to propose a solution to the question.
